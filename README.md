# VueNode App

VueNode is a web application built with Vue.js on the frontend and Node.js on the backend. This app serves as a template for a full-stack JavaScript application and demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality with a RESTful API.

## Features

- Create.
- Vue.js frontend that communicates with a Node.js backend.
- RESTful API for managing data.
- Minimalistic and customizable project structure.

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime for the server.
- [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) - Vue.js development environment.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - NoSQL database (required for database functionality).
